Generate QA Report document from template using the TVP-SDD-Dev CLI.

## What This Workflow Does

When invoked, this workflow will:
1. Run the command: `sdd-gen /qa-report <featureName>`
2. Generate a QA Report document template in `docs/test-reports/{featureName}/{featureName}-qa-report.md`
3. The document will also be copied to AI tool folders (.devin, .opencode, .claude, .antigravity) if they exist

## Input

Provide the feature name as input:
```
Feature name: user-authentication
```

## What Gets Generated

The QA Report document template includes:
- Test Execution Summary
- Test Results Overview
- Browser Test Results
- Failed Tests
- Flaky Tests
- Performance Metrics
- Coverage Report
- Artifacts (Screenshots, Videos, Traces)
- Issues Found
- Fixes Applied
- Regression Tests
- Ship Readiness

## Prerequisites

Before using this workflow, ensure:
- Tests have been executed using `/qa-test-run` command
- Test results are available in test-results/ directory
- You have access to test artifacts and metrics

## After Generation

After the QA Report is generated, you should:
1. Fill in the template with actual test results
2. Document all failed tests and their causes
3. Track issues found during testing
4. Document fixes applied for each issue
5. Specify regression tests needed
6. Assess ship readiness based on test results
7. Use the report for UAT sign-off with clients

## Notes

- The report serves as formal documentation for stakeholders
- This should be created after test execution is complete
- The template provides structure - you need to fill in actual test results
